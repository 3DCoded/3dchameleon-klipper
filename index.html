        # Unofficial Klipper Support for 3DChameleon
        ### A highly configurable klipper extras module and configuration for the 3DChameleon

        **Features:**
        - Many configuration options
        - Using the filament sensor to allow for more reliable loads and unloads
        - Many helpful macros and G-Code commands
        - Saving the state of the 3DChameleon to reduce the guesswork

        **Planned Features:**
        - Support for multiple filament sensors to reduce failed unloads (See
        https://github.com/3DCoded/3dchameleon-klipper/issues/4)
        - Support for "telling" the Chameleon what tool is loaded based on the filament sensors
        - Ability to assist with initially loading the Chameleon (see
        https://github.com/3DCoded/3dchameleon-klipper/issues/5)
        - More configuration options
        - More helpful macros and G-Code commands
        - Helpful messages to help to diagnose the cause of a failed load or unload

        For information on setup and usage, configuration, and more, please see [the

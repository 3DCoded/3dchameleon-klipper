# Unofficial Klipper Support for 3DChameleon
### A highly configurable klipper extras module and configuration for the 3DChameleon

**UPDATE:** I have since moved away from the Chameleon and made the [3MS](https://github.com/3dcoded/3ms) for Klipper. If you have Klipper, I highly recommend it due to its simplicity, ease of control, and low cost.

**Features:**
- Many configuration options
- Using the filament sensor to allow for more reliable loads and unloads
- Many helpful macros and G-Code commands
- Saving the state of the 3DChameleon to reduce the guesswork
- Helping in tip shaping with a flexible macro
- Assigning different tip shaping parameters for each filament
- Detailed documentation to diagnose common issues
- KlipperScreen control panel for the Chameleon
- Support for Klipperized Auto3DClippy
- Support for normal Auto3DClippy

**Planned Features:**
- Support for multiple filament sensors to reduce failed unloads (See https://github.com/3DCoded/3dchameleon-klipper/issues/4)
- Support for "telling" the Chameleon what tool is loaded based on the filament sensors
- Ability to assist with initially loading the Chameleon (see https://github.com/3DCoded/3dchameleon-klipper/issues/5)
- LCD control panel for the Chameleon (see https://github.com/3DCoded/3dchameleon-klipper/issues/9)

For information on setup and usage, configuration, and more, please see [the Documentation](https://3dcoded.github.io/3dchameleon-klipper/)
